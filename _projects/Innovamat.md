At Innovamat, I served as a Unity Developer, actively contributing to the digital product. During my time there, I developed math-focused gamified activities for primary school students, math support tools, and casual games for classroom breaks.

In my later role as a Tech Lead for the Platform team, I led a multi-disciplinary effort to enhance and extend the company's mobile and web apps. I took pride in driving technological advancements to continually improve our educational solutions.
